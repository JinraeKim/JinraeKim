### Hi, I'm Jinrae Kim
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Flight Dynamics and Control Laboratory](http://fdcl.snu.ac.kr/wordpress/), Seoul National University.
I'm seeking theoretical and algorithmic developments of data-driven dynamical system control and aerospace applications.

I love to contribute to open-source projects, especially in [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).

### Research interests
- Function approximation, data-driven optimal control, and reinforcement learning
- Convex optimisation and differentiable optimisation
- Differential equations and system theory
- Aerospace engineering applications

### Programming
- Julia, Python, MATLAB, etc.
